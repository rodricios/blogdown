Ancient scriptures tell us that early ancient peoples were so well 
organized, due to there being only one spoken and understandable 
language, that they decided their next earthly feat would be to reach the heavens. 

> “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens; 
let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.

The story goes on to say that God, for whatever reason, was not O.K. with these ancient people's 
endeavor *of building a tower reaching the heavens* (who's the genius behind this plan?). 

Logically speaking, if one is not O.K. with a direction that someone or some group is taking, 
then the action one takes to derail that person's or group's plan is justified, right?

> And the Lord said, “Indeed the people are one and they all have one language, [..] now 
nothing that they propose to do will be withheld from them. Come, let Us go down and there
confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”

#The Frequency Distribution

If I were the universal captain of Earth and the greater Planets and Stars, my 
first unquestionable mandate would be to make everyone's first word be 
"the"; second word "frequency"; third "distribution". 

Why? Facetiousness aside, it's because frequency distributions are the unsung
heroes of most if not all the latest and greatest projects being labeled as "AI"

And these frequency-distribution-powered AI projects aren't as benign as an autocomplete
program, which I'll walk you guys and gals through later in this post. 

I'm talking about projects like Microsoft's [*How Old?*](http://how-old.net) (powered by their spectacular 
suite of machine learning tools titled [*Project Oxford*](http://www.projectoxford.ai)) and 
Google's word2vec (where you can do ungodly things [like subtract words from other
words to get mathematically similar words](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/#Interesting_properties_of_the_word_vectors), WTF?!). 


So what's a frequency distribution anyways? For those who don't know, and forgive my
language, frequency distributions are a *thing* that tries to describe how *often* 
other *things* appear/occur/arise/happen.

Paraphrasing Dr. Seuss's *Cat in the Hat*: 

> Thing One appeared once, Thing Two appeared once. 

Great, here's a frequency distribution demonstrating the above statement:

```
(the number of hyphens/dashes represents the number of times a Thing appeared)
	Thing One | -
	Thing Two | - 
```

If it said *Thing One appeared twice*, we'd have this: 

```
	Thing One | --
	Thing Two | - 
```
